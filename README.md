This is a personal development portfolio site for Edward Jeong.

I used gatsby-starter-strata template to begin and modified as needed.

### Author

### Deployment

this site is deployed at
https://portfolio-edward.netlify.com/

### Installation

To install the application in a local dev environment, run `yarn install` in the root folder. Then, run `yarn start`.

### Memo

needed navbar and components are added and the site starts without an error.
For next, left side menu and right side display should be separate area (currently right side overlaps left side menu)
